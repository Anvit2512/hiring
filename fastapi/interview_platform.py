    Please evaluate the response based on the following criteria:
    
    Clarity: Is the response clear and well-structured?
    Accuracy: Does the response contain accurate information?
    Completeness: Does the response fully address the question, or are there any missing points?
    Relevance: Is the response focused on the question without unnecessary details?
    
    Provide feedback in a friendly, constructive tone. Be specific about areas where the candidate did well and where they can improve. 
    At the end, rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being an excellent answer.
